This was the final project for Predictive Analytics where my group developed a predictive model forecasting Uber and Lyft prices utilizing ride and weather datasets. We ran a backward elimination method on training data to select the most important variables in determining ride price. Then, we reduced the number of numerical variables through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and built a linear regression model with the selected principal components. Based on our analysis, we found that the pricing models of Uber and Lyft are largely based on distance and the type of ride (number of passengers). However, based on the data, Lyft differs from Uber with their surge multiplier for price which is implemented for people calling rides from high demand areas. We found that the most important factors in predicting the price of an Uber or a Lyft are distance and
the type of ride (premium, size).
